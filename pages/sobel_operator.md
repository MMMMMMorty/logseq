## Sobel operator performs a 2-D spatial gradient operation on an image to enhance the edges. The operator consists of a pair of 3-by-3 convolution kernels (two for the two perpendicular directions) that are separately applied to an image to produce the approximate gradients for each pixel for detecting edges in vertical and horizontal directions
