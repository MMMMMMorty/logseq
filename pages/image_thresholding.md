title: Image thresholding
---

## Image thresholding is used to binarize the image based on pixel intensities. The input to such thresholding algorithm is usually a grayscale image and a threshold. The output is a binary image.
### 二值化图片
## If the intensity of a pixel in the input image is greater than a threshold, the corresponding output pixel is marked as white (foreground), and if the input pixel intensity intensity is less than or equal to the threshold, the output pixel location is marked black (background). 设置阈值，高于阈值是前景，低于阈值是背景
